Application Usage:
This application acts as a proxy server with SSL support, designed to intercept, forward, and 
potentially block HTTP and HTTPS requests based on a list of forbidden sites. Users launch it 
with command-line arguments specifying a listening port, a forbidden sites file, and a log file 
path.

Internal Design:
The proxy listens for client requests, forks a child process for each connection, and checks 
if the request targets a forbidden site. Allowed HTTP requests are directly forwarded, while 
HTTPS requests are relayed through an SSL-secured connection to the destination. Access details, 
including blocked attempts, are logged. The proxy can dynamically reload the forbidden sites list 
upon receiving a SIGINT signal, ensuring resource cleanup post-request handling.
